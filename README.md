### Project Overview
The KuGouGo/Rules project primarily focuses on converting traditional Mihomo format rules into the MRS format. It uses scripts for this conversion and stores domain and IP CIDR information separately in `domain` and `ipcidr` files.

### Key Features
- **Conversion Scripts**: Scripts are used to convert traditional Mihomo format rules into the MRS format.
- **Domain Storage**: Domain information is stored in `domain` files.
- **IP CIDR Storage**: IP CIDR information is stored in `ipcidr` files.

### Technologies and Tools Used
- **Scripting Language**: Likely uses a scripting language such as Python, Bash, or a similar language for the conversion scripts.
- **File Storage**: Plain text files or similar formats for storing domain and IP CIDR information.

### File Structure
The project likely includes the following structure:
- **Scripts Directory**: Contains the scripts used for conversion.
- **Domains Directory**: Contains files storing domain information.
- **IPCidr Directory**: Contains files storing IP CIDR information.
